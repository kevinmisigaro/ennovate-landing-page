          <h4>About the Program</h4>
          <p>
            Empowering Sustainable Entrepreneurship in Africa 2025 is Phase Two
            of an initiative to strengthen climate innovation across Tanzania,
            Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,and Mozambique.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2024, Village Capital, in partnership with Norway, through Norad
            â€“ the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, supported 14
            Entrepreneur Support Organizations (ESOs)/Ecosystem Builders through
            training and capacity building (read about Phase One here).
            <br />
            <br />
            This year, we have joined the mission to support impact-creating
            founders and strengthen the Tanzania ecosystem by collaborating with
            Village Capital.

          <h4>The Sustainability Crisis in Africa</h4>

          <p>
            Despite Africa&apos;s immense potential in greentech, startups in
            the sector face persistent challenges, including chronic
            underinvestment, fragmented support systems, and generic training
            programs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Systemic challenges such as limited capital, investor skepticism,
            and bureaucratic hurdles continue to slow progress. Without targeted
            interventions, the green transformation in sub- Saharan Africa will
            remain out of reach.
